# Plastic
Plastic is a fps game currently being developed with unity by me (GrizzlyStudios), it will be primarly built for webgl as you can only play webgl games on school laptops since you cant download executables.
I will be releasing a downloadable copy once the game gets released as it currently is not a game and is just a few scripts i have made so far.
The game will be set in various maps made with toys, the game wont be set in a bedroom or a playroom with toys like many games do instead the game will be set in a world made with toys it will be like other fps maps except it will be built out of toys and the characters will be toys. It will be an objective based fps game where the focus will be controlling points disarming bombs etc. it will be more like rainbow six seige or battlefeild instead of call of duty where you just run around killing people for no reason.
It will have a physics based movement system like titanfall or titanfall 2, this will allow for more ways to get around maps and a cooler feel than classic movement systems.
There will be a strong focus on clans/regiments/teams like in the mobile game pixel gun 3d but with a strong focus on clan v clan battles and clan tournements etc.


# Current Build Status
